todo: add a picture box to the asset details, with a default placeholder pic "fetched" from the server
      underneath or next to it, a file chooser button, and when the file is chosen (onchanged?)
      bring up an 'upload' button (api route is done: '/file-upload'). on success, display the pic in the 
      pic box in place of the default.

      2-step process - upload pic with req.files.thumbnail.path and req.files.thumbnail.name, path being the username/slug and 
      name being the dnaCode plus whatever the extension is.
      step two, update the asset with .imageUrl.
      then setState with the image(s) in place on the detail page. there may be more than one image.

      validation-y bits
            username must be usable as a folder name - work out or find a regexp and apply it.
